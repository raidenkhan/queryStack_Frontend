# Project Structur
<h1>Proj-Styles: </h1> <span>contains all the css stylings. You will see your section style as a separate file hence that's where you are supposed to work so the code doesn't mix up</span>
<h1>Index.html</h1> <span>This is the html file we are dealing with </span>

# queryStack_Frontend
Please alway update your forks
Then pull anytime you see new changes before you make your own
I'll create a branch for each of you please wait

#
Fork the branch corresponding to your name that's where you'll be working
#Note
Once you set yourself up try pushing a dummy file to your branch let me see the branch rules take effect

# Note : Don't push to main !!!!!!!!!!!

# Template Layout
With the template layout I have given in my html is how the page will look  like in terms of sections
<p>In view of that everyone should just choose a section and work on it after they push then i'll merge until we are done</p>
<p>Media queries and detailed designs will come later but let's get a working page first</p>

# local bootstrap
You can feel free to use the local version of the boostrap files as opposed to the cdn in case you don't have an internet connection
