I'll create a branch for each of you please wait

#
Fork the branch corresponding to your name that's where you'll be working
#Note
Once you set yourself up try pushing a dummy file to your branch let me see the branch rules take effect

# Note : Don't push to main !!!!!!!!!!!

# Template Layout
With the template layout I have given in my html is how the page will look  like in terms of sections
<p>In view of that everyone should just choose a section and work on it after they push then i'll merge until we are done</p>
<p>Media queries and detailed designs will come later but let's get a working page first</p>
